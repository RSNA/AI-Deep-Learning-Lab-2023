# MIDRC – Building and Using AI-Ready Datasets from a Massive Open Data Commons 

### MIDRC at RSNA 2023: Deep Learning Lab

## Session Date & Time

**Tuesday, November 28 from 10:30 - 11:30am CST** 

This session, led by principal investigators of MIDRC will give an overview of the structure of the MIDRC data commons and a tour of the open access data portal published on the Gen3 platform. During this session, attendees will have the opportunity to experience how to build a selected data cohort direct from the MIDRC data commons for AI research.


## 1. Intro to MIDRC (short overview) and moderator; how are data important to deep learning [5 min]
- Adam Flanders (Thomas Jefferson)
- Maryellen Giger (University of Chicago)

## 2. Building cohorts, LOINC mapping, jupyter notebooks, and downloading (interactive hands-on) [30 min]

- Paul Kinahan (University of Washington)
- Chris Meyers (University of Chicago)
- Jordan Fuhrman (University of Chicago)
- Heather Whitney (University of Chicago)
