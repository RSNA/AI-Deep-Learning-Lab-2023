    "MONAILabel has several pretrained models that may be useful for your projects. However, there is currently no pretrained CT model that has exactly 2 labels.

    "### Add active learning modules\n",
    "For the last step of our customization, we will add a few codeblocks that enable calculation of epistemic loss. This will allow us to use active learning to accelerate data labeling in MONAILabel. First we need to add some additional imports at the top of the script:\n",

    "* `--conf skip_scoring false` - this tells MONAILabel to score each of the unlabeled studies using the `scoring_method` we defined previously.\n",
    "* `--conf skip_strategies false` - this enables the active learning `strategy` method that we defined previously.\n",
